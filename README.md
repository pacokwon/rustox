# [WIP] `rlox`
Rust implementation of the Lox language, from the book [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/).

This version of Lox is a compiled language, targeting a custom stack-based VM.

The implementation may vary greatly, since the original implementation in the book is written in C.
