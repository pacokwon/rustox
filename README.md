# Rustox (WIP)
Rust implementation of the Lox language, from the book [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/).

This implementation of Lox features:
- A bytecode compiler
- A bytecode virtual machine
- Pratt parsing
- Full programming language constructs (WIP)
- (etc.)

**NOTE**: The implementation may vary greatly, as the original implementation in the book is written in C.
